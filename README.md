Hey there! 👋 I'm Satyam.
I'm into web development and love building cool stuff for the web. 💻
When I'm not coding, I'm either buried in books 📚 or battling it out in mobile games 🎮.
Currently, I'm on a journey to master web development from scratch. 🚀
Fun Fact: I once built a mini-game using only HTML and CSS! 🎉
